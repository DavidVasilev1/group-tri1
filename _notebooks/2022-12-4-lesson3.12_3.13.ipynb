    "- Procedure Name - the name that is given to a function/procedure\n",
    "- Parameters - a variable that is used in a function to allow for data to be imported into a function\n",

    "### Functions - Basic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can be created in many different languages. Below are some examples in Collegeboard's format, Python, and Javascript.\n",

    "![collegeboard-format](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111480448/206083549-4380cd04-187d-4786-9e40-6f87968cd3de.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, the function is defined as ```PROCEDURE```, which tells the coder that this is a function. The function is then named with ```procName```, which is simply how the function is identified. ```parameter1, parameter2,...``` are variables that can be predefined elsewhere and repeatedly used in the same function. This will be gone over later in the lesson so don't worry if you don't get it. ```block of statements``` are just things that you would place inside a function to complete a certain task, such as ```print()``` in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "def function(a,b): # function is defined\n",
    "  print(a+b) # prints output of variables\n",
    "\n",
    "function(1,2) # one instance that it can be used\n",
    "function(2,3) # another instance\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "3\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is similar to the Collegeboard example, where ```def``` defines the function, ```function```, and then is followed by parameters ```a,b```, which can later be interchanged with any numbers as shown with ```function(1,2)```. The numbers are called arguments, which are information provided to the function with parameters. In this case, the parameters are being added within the function and then printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Javascript\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "function Function(a,b) {\n",
    "  return a + b;\n",
    "}\n",

    "Function(1,2)\n",
    "Function(2,3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "3\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Javascript in this case is almost the exact same as Python, the only differences being that function is called with ```function``` and that the formatting is a little different. Otherwise, it does the exact same thing as the Python example.\n",
