            "content": "Topic 3.12 (3A) Calling &amp; Understanding Procedures - Kaiden &amp; Amay . Overview: Learning Objectives . Basics of Procedures | Calling Procedures | Determine Results of Procedures | . What is a procedure? . Essential Knowledge: . A procedure is a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values. May be called &quot;method&quot; or &quot;function&quot; in different programming languages. | . | Parameters are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result. It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values. | Procedures can be classified as sequencing, selection, and iteration. How? | . Example: . What is the procedure&#39;s name? | What are the parameters? | What did the procedure return? | . x = 5 y = 3 def multiply(x, y): product = x * y return product answer = multiply(x, y) print(&quot;The product of&quot;, x, &quot;times&quot;, y, &quot;is&quot;, answer) . The product of 5 times 3 is 15 . Calling Procedures . To call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure | Procedures do not require parameters, but the parentheses must be there | . Ex: . procedureName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) | How would you call this procedure? | . num = 5 def math(x): op1 = x * 2 op2 = op1 - 9 return op2 . Determining the Result of a Procedure . To determine the result of a procedure, you must follow the code line by line and see what each one does | Using syntax, you can determine the result by output parameters | return codes | . | To use return codes, you have to write the syntax return followed by the variable you would like to return var | . Ex: . return x . | This effectively exits a function and instructs python to continue executing the program and to return a certain value . | Value can be string, a tuple, or any other object that is being sent back to the main program | . Figure out why this function doesn&#39;t work, Then convert the binary output into decimal form: . def find_cube(num): result = bin(num * num * num) cube = find_cube(3) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube) . Cube: None . Quiz (Part of Hacks) . Complete this quiz: . questionNum = 3 correct = 0 questions = [&quot;What is are correct names for a procedure? n A) Method n B) Function n C) Both&quot;, &quot;What is a procedure? n A) Sequencing n B) Selection n C) Iteration n D) All&quot;, &quot;Use this for following question: n def inchesToFeet(lengthInches): n t lengthFeet = lengthInches / 12 n t return lengthFeet n n What is the procedure name, the parameter, and what the procedure returns? n A) feetToInches, lengthInches, lengthMeters n B) inchesToFeet, lengthInches, lengthFeet n C) inchesToFeet, lengthFeet, lengthInches n D) lengthInches, inchesToFeet, lengthFeet&quot;] answers = [&quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] def qna(question, answer): print(&quot;Question:&quot;, question) response = input() print(&quot;Answer:&quot;, response) if response.lower() == answer: print(&quot;Correct :) n&quot;) global correct correct += 1 else: print(&quot;Incorrect :( n&quot;) for x in range(questionNum): qna(questions[x], answers[x]) print(&quot;Score:&quot;, correct, &quot;/ 3&quot;) . Topic 3.13 (3B) Managing Complexity - Safin . Topic 3.13 (3C) Developing Procedures - David &amp; Alex . Hacks . Topic 3.12 (3A): . Define procedure and parameter in your own words | Paste a screenshot of completion of the quiz | Code a procedure that finds the square root of any given number. (make sure to call and return the function) ### Topic 3.13 (3B): | ### Topic 3.13 (3C): | | Rubric . Each hack is worth 1/3 of a point . To get the 1/3 point for each hack you must: Complete each hack correctly and completely | Submit by 8:00AM on Tuesday, December 13 | . | Anything missing or submitted late will have points deducted | .",
